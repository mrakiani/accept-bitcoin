#Accept Bitcoin ![accept-bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/7/74/BC_Rnd_64px.png)

Finally a developer-friendly tool to simply accept bitcoins in your site. 

  - Lite and fast, built on top of [bitcore](http://bitcore.io).
  - No need to install local bitcoin node RPC client. We use [blockr](http://blockr.io) API instead.
  - No need to install any wallet client. 
  - Create ad-hoc address to accept bitcoins and transfer incomes to your offline account.
  - Easy configurations.

##Get Started

Simply install via [npm](https://npmjs.org/):

```javascript
npm install accept-bitcoin
```
Load AC and you're ready to go!
```javascript
var acceptBitcoin = require('accept-bitcoin');
var ac = new acceptBitcoin('YOUR_BITCOIN_ADDRESS');
```

##Motivation 
Accepting bitcoins online can be complex to program and require you to install a bitcoin RPC client in order to read and write to the blockchain. This client require a lot of resources (in terms of CPU, networking and storage).  
Most of the users are using a wallet to store their bitcoins. This wallet is a simple way to secure your public and private key. For security reasons you better save this wallet offline in a "cold storage".

##Example
You can override the default settings on creating

Examples are provided [here](https://github.com/sagivo/accept-bitcoin/tree/master/examples)
```javascript
var settings = {network: 'live'}
var acceptBitcoin = require('accept-bitcoin');
var ac = new acceptBitcoin('YOUR_BITCOIN_ADDRESS', settings);
key = ac.generateAddress({alertWhenHasBalance: true});
console.log("Hello buyer! please pay to: " + key.address());
key.on('hasBalance', function(amount){
  console.log("thanks for paying me " + amount); //do stuff
  key.transferBalanceToMyAccount(function(err, d){
    if (d.status === 'success') console.log("Cool, the bitcoins are in my private account!");
  });
});
```

###Key class
This class is responsible for creating new bitcoin addresses, storing them and transferring funds between them. Some key functions are:  
`storeKey(wk)` - store your key in a local file. Can be encrypted.  
`checkBalance()`- check and notify you when an address has minimum balance.
`payTo(payToAddress, options, callback)` - transfer all balance of this address to another address.

###Encrypt class
Contains helpers to encrypt and decrypt strings. Used for storing your keys data locally.  

##Contribute
Please do. Fork it, star it, share it and add your code to the project. Help others.  
All the src code is written in [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org) and is under `src`. There's a tool that convert it automatically to js each time you change a file and put it under `lib` folder. Simply run `cake build` for that.
